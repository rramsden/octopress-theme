My co-worker says blogging everyday seems like a ridiculous waste of time. However, I'm starting
to notice something. *I'm actually learning shit*. Writing about a different topic each day forces 
you to do research and then understand a topic so well that your able to describe it. In other words, in
order to explain something you have to know what the hell your talking about.

That being said, even though writing has been challenging it has been a very rewarding experience for me. Today I spent the entire 
day revising blog posts that were rushed for the sake of blogging everyday. 
Its been a real struggle so far but I think its getting easier... maybe...

Figuring out topics to blog about is pretty easy though. Its just I have to pick my topics
carefully. On weekends I can look into more advanced topics. Weekdays however
I need to be careful. Since I've been working all day I usually come home tired and well... that leads
to some really short blog posts if what I'm talking about requires lots of research.

Yep, writing is difficult. Fin.
