This weekend I decided to checkout [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) which is a functional
programming language built on top of the Erlang VM. The language addresses Erlang's lack of
meta-programming facilities which are common to many modern programming languages.

Coming from a background in Ruby and Erlang I'm pretty excited. Why is that?
Well Elixir borrows all the awesome bits from Ruby that let us be productive
and couples it with Erlang's ability to build rock-solid highly concurrent
apps. This IMO is a pretty bad-ass combination.
